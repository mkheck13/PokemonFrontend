## Shout Outs:
**Brock Spacek:** For helping me with my shiny button issues.

**Comments:** Everything looks and works nicely. Except for the favoites list when you check it it only shows the objects. It is also a bit hard to tell which things you can click I would suggest adding cursor-pointer to see it.
